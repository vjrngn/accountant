## Introduction
___
Invoicing plays an integral part in any business.

Accountant aims to be the first feature-rich, developer friendly, API driven invoicing system that provides a flexible platform for any individual / business to easily integrate invoicing into their platform.

This app does not provide a frontend implemenation. It is *purely* api driven and consumers are at liberty to implement their own GUIs. If however,in the future we have enough support and demand for an opnionated GUI, we may implement one.
